### Creating Issues

Please include the following when reporting a bug:

* Browser (brand, version)
* OS (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, etc) and version (Windows 10, Windows 7, etc)
* Server OS it's running on
* Mobile/Desktop and display resolution
* Page where the bug occurred
* What you were doing when the bug occurred
* Please be specific about what you were seeing. This will make it easier to debug and will require fewer follow-up questions.
  * Avoid descriptions like "hover effects aren't working" or "the button isn't working"
  * A more descriptive (and helpful) statement might be "I clicked submit and nothing happened and it said CAPTCHA failed, but the checkbox was green"
